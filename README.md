# Web3-Play-Physics
Learn Kinematics in a fun and an engaging manner using WRLDS iot ball, connected android app and Web3 eco-system tools powered by Moralis, BNB, Covalent and Multichain.

We are developing Covalent API Endpoints, one for fetching the total counter, user details and time stamp and the other for the token_ids of user ratings.

About: Physical world game simulator, playground -- you can add geometrical shapes, or draw your own shapes, do educational experiments, learn using the WRLDS iot connected balls, mobile SDKs, BNB, Covalent endpoints and Multi-chain messaging protocol, and see them come to life with forces (think gravity, Newton!), friction (scrrrrape), and inertia (ahh, slow down!).

Features

Multi Player Game: Interactive and easy way to learn physics. Real-time experience to teach kids various laws of motion, sound waves, or light. Physics is everywhere!

Learning Together: Games and the activities are designed to involve children in different team buildling activities. WRLDS iot ball makes learning and fun lot more easier.

Fun with Physics: Physics explains how things move and how different kinds of energy can affect these things. Once someone understands the rules of physics, itâ€™s possible to understand how the whole universe works! 


Impact

Learning Anytime Anywhere:  Physics relate to everyday life. Interactive way of learning helps in better and seamless adoption of science among young kids. 

Mass Reach: Web3 Play Physics is simple app which with the help of connected WRLDS ball, mobile phone and Web3 solutions powered by BNB, Cobvalent and Multi-chain can give real-time experience to various laws in physics like law of motion, energy, force and other key topics of Kinematics.
